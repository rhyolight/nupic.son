<p>
Thank you for submitting a task for Google Code-in 2013.  Please be sure to upload the following documents immediately as they need to be submitted and verified by Google Code-in Program Administrators so that you will be eligible to receive prizes [0].
- a signed Parental Consent Form from your legal parent or guardian. Please visit the link below to download the Parental Consent form in your preferred language [1].
- a copy of a pre-university, high school, or secondary school student ID or proof of enrollment*
</p>

<p>
Once your task has been accepted you will need to do the following in order to receive any prizes (if you have already uploaded your forms and they have been marked *verified* on your student profile page then you do not need to submit any other forms. Thank you):
1.  visit {{ student_forms_link }} and
2.  upload your signed Parental Consent form and your proof of enrollment (one at a time) in the appropriate section within the *next 48 hours* after completing your first task.
</p>

<p>
Please note that prizes will be shipped the first week of February 2014. Most students will receive them by February 15, 2014.
</p>

<p>
Remember, you only have to do this once, but PARTICIPANTS WHO FAIL TO RETURN A SIGNED PARENTAL CONSENT AND STUDENT ID BY JANUARY 6, 2014 WILL BE INELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ANY PRIZES.  We want to send you prizes, so we suggest doing this as soon as your task is accepted.

*Any one of following documents is considered acceptable proof of enrollment:
-a scanned copy of your student identification card that shows you were enrolled as of 18 November 2013.  The card must have a date that shows you are currently enrolled: a start date sometime in 2013 by itself is not enough.
-a transcript or course list (official or unofficial is fine) showing the courses you were enrolled in as of 18 November 2013.  Transcript in .txt format is NOT acceptable, but a .pdf or .jpeg of the transcript is.
-a letter from your student affairs or admissions office stating that you were enrolled as of 18 November 2013.
-if you are homeschooled, you must provide a proof of enrollment from your cover school.
